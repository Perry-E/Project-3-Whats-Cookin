# Project 3 - Startup Week (Whatâ€™s Cookin)

## What is your application? 

Essentially this app is where users can subscribe to a service where they can select different cuisines and recipes of their preference and follow along step by step with the recipes provided 

Users can also submit their own recipes that can be reviewed (based on a rating system) and can comment on them accordingly

Users will have their own profiles where they can 
Manage their recipes of choice, (what they are planning to cook etc) - Planner
Contribute their own ideas/recipes to the growing list of recipes on the app - My recipes
Settings - TBC (Maybe to update user info)

## What value does your application provide to your audience?
It's an avenue for users to track their workload accordingly, observe relevant trends in the procedures that they conoduct, so that they can properly plan for future procedures (i.e. busiest months, weeks, morning or afternoon sessions etc.) Information that otherwise would not be shared/tracked by clinics. So instead of users having to create their own spreadsheets etc, they can simply sign up for an account and let this application do the work for them.
 
## What steps have we taken to entice users?
Surveys and questionaires have been sent out to potential users, to try and include as many features as possible, that can potentially aid them in their daily lives.
